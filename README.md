# WheatPlotsEnclave
We explore various visualizations from a simple histogram to parallel coordinates chart and even compute the correlation matrix using the wheat seeds data set which is generated by recording X-Ray measurements of various wheat kernels.

We also perform high dimensional classification and benchmark training and predicting times using both SVC and K-neighbors, that gives a 2D matrix of feature vs feature plots against one another. With this we try understand how each pair of features stack against the other.
